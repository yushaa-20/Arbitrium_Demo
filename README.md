In setting up the Arbitrum Environment, I opened the metamask extension I already installed previously and clicked on the default chain
(Ethereum mainnet). Scroll down and clicked on "Add Network", and a pop up came asking for the details about the network I am about to add.
Which I copied from the "solidity programming 3.1 model" and added the network successfully. Afther I added the Arbitrum Sepolia network, I went back to the chain menu, scroll down and selected the Arbitrum sepolia network.

In getting the Arbitrum Sepolia testnet tokens, I followed the youtube video guide given to us. But it did not worked for me, I used the links provided in the discord group to get the ethereum sepolia and bridge it to Arbitrum sepolia. And that was all and the token appeared in the metamask wallet.

I now went to my remix IDE and create the file named "HelloArbitrum.sol", where I wrote the codes in the solidity programming course 3.2, compile it and have no issues with that. Afther which I connected my remix IDE to metamask using the "injected provider-metamask" under the deploy environment. Deploy it to the Arbitrum sepolia, confirm the transaction in metamask and it works.

I copied the contract address and run it in the arbiscan and confirmed the transactions.
